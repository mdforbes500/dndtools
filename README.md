# D&D Tools for 5th Edition
A suite of opensource tools for the aspiring 5th edition Dungeon Master. The goal of this project is to be able to use procedural generation to build settlements.

Most of this code is written in python, but there is also some SQL. I'll add to this later. **pet project**

Yeah, you can't use this to make money. Also, I don't own D&D or anything that it has created. This is just to make rolling up settlements more of a breeze. It is not a commerical project. Anything derived from this project also needs to be free and let people know that they should buy Wizards of the Coast's D&D products ot play the game. If you don't, foo-bar on you. ~mdforbes500
